📬 Portfolio Contact Form – Flask Web App
This is a personal portfolio contact form web app built using Flask (Python). The goal of the project is to let visitors fill out a form and send their message directly to my email (donsavio1one@gmail.com).

When a user submits the form:

Their name, email, and message are collected.

The message is sent to my Gmail using a secure app password.

A success message appears on the same page without redirecting.
